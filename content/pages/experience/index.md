  <p>
    Since 2010 I work as a sysadmin and later devops engineer (I suspect I did a lot of devops while a sysadmin anyway taking care of everything from monitoring to git strategies and continuous integration )

    I&#8217;ve been involved with computers ever since I was 11 years old. During the years I worked quite a few jobs from this field: cabling, service, installing and configuring and for the last few (<em><strong>2015</strong></em>Â <em><strong>update</strong></em>: not so few anymore, <strong>2018 </strong>update a few more years as a devops engineer) years as a network and system administrator and then devops engineer. Having worked from such an early age I have the advantage of knowing my way around obsolete systems as well as around the latest and greatest.

    This is another virus I caught at an early age. Probably around 12 or so. I rediscovered some years later when I got my hands on a digital camera. I&#8217;ve been happily shooting digital since 2002 though I do expose the ocasional roll of Kodak (for as long as they will be around at least)

    I enjoy play^H^H^H working with embedded systems (pic development boards, raspberry pi and lately a sopine based cluster), contributing to open source projects (translations and bug reports), writing on my various sites and roaming the cities and nature with my camera. Time permitting I also volunteer with local NGOs mainly <a href="http://www.animallife.ro/">Animal Life</a> and <a href="http://www.aleg-romania.eu/">A.L.E.G.</a><br /> Years ago I also did web and graphics design. Lately I only do this kind of work for personal projects and the abovementioned NGOs
