Having just updated to the latest set of slackware current packages I found that the trusty old Dia would segfault:

```bash
\*\* (dia:26707): CRITICAL \*\*: dia_renderer_set_size: assertion \`irenderer != NULL' failed
Segmentation fault
```

With Ubuntu to the rescue ðŸ™‚ according to [this report][1] I found the fix to be:

Edit $(HOME)/.dia/persistence and change the value from **false** to **true**.

[cce_xml]

<p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1369907323211_378">
  Â Â <dia:boolean role="view_antialised"><br /> <dia:attribute name="booleanvalue"><br /> <dia:boolean val="true"/><br /> </dia:attribute><br /> </dia:boolean>
</p>

[/cce_xml]

Please note that this fix works only ifÂ $(HOME)/.dia/persistence already exists. What this does (from the bug report):

> i.e. make the antialiased rendering default. And please don't use the
> View/AntiAliased menu item to toggle the renderer later, because that would
> trigger the crash again.
