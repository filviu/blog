I chose [Linode][1] but I will leave that for another article.

I decided to use postfix + courier + mysql and virtual domains for my mail setup. Everythig was configured fine and dandy according to the documentation. But I kept getting this in the logs:  
[ccNe_bash]  
Mar 6 13:54:42 saslauthd [5734]: pam\_mysql - required option "db" is not set Mar 6 13:54:42 saslauthd [5734]: DEBUG: auth\_pam: pam_authenticate failed: Error in service module  
Mar 6 13:54:42 saslauthd \[5734]: do_auth : auth failure: [user=test@xxxxxxx.com\] \[service=smtp\] \[realm=xxxxxxx.com\] \[mech=pam\] [reason=PAM auth error]  
[/ccNe_bash]  
I went over the config files over and over again searching for mistakes, because I usually mix something up but nothing worked. After some time I realized that the error_ **"db" not set**_ is more important than I thought. It meant that it's not about wrong passwords copied from examples.

Well, the problem was that in **/etc/pam.d/smtpÂ  the password for the mysql user cannot contain the # character.** And my password had. I have used a random password generator and by luck it contained a #. Everything after that was ignored, that's why it said **db not set**. That's a lost hour for nothing. Everywhere elese in the many config files containing this password it's ok to have a # but not here.
