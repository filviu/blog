1. the **/var/lib/asterisk/moh** is missing (or has the wrong permissions). Be sure it's there and has the right owner (asterix:asterix) and permissions

2. Sox has to be installed. What the error logs miss to inform at the first glance is that you also need **mpg123** otherwise you'll get this:

Error Processing: "sox failed to convert file and original could not be copied as a fall back" for Johnny Cash - Solitary Man.mp3!

##### This is not a fatal error, your Music on Hold may still work.

Have fun.
