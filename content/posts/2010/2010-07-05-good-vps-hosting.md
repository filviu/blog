Like I said some time ago I had to move my websites from a shared host (bluehost) to a dedicated sollution. Well, the websites I host (for clients, friends and myself) don't account for the need of a dedicated server so I searched for a virtual sollution.

I finally came to the conclusion that unmanaged is the way for me. I'm working on the old premise "give me a machine, an IP, a net pipe and some power" and I'll manage from there.

Finally after some research I was left with two: [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=16a04aa4c234b0d0edf8bf518ca11356448e1975). From the features listed and user testimonials I found on various forums they are equally good. Simply when I needed to sign up Linode offered more space and RAM for the same amount of money, so the choice was easy.

What I like:

  * recently awarded more RAM as a 7 year [Linode][1] anniversary.
  * broad choice of operating systems
  * root access including console (if you borke your ssh daemon you can still login)
  * disk image tools
  * custom warnings on cpu, memory and bandwithÂ  increasing over certain limits _**you get to define**_(not that you are penalised but it simply means you probabbly have something hanging)
  * you can choose the datacenter and move your machine from one to another
  * you can easily buy more resources (ram, disk, bandwith)
  * It was never down for me
  * DNS manager
  * Statistics and everything

What I don't like:

  * no symbian application or mobile admin website (only iphone and maybe android) - not a big deal, I still have an ssh client on my phone and the regular website works decent on my nokia's browser

So, if you're in the market for a virtual host I can recommend **[Linode][1]** from all my heart.
