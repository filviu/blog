I use flowplayer for joomla quite often. I usually use this plugin:

<http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/multimedia/multimedia-players/video-players-a-gallery/7377>

Unfortunately it uses an old version of flowplayer. So, since both are GPL I decided to update the plugin and share it.

You can download it here: [plg_upd_flowplayer_J15_v1-1-0][1]
