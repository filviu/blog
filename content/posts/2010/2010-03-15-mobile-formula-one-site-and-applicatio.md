I used up until last race the nice live-f1 application to see live timings in the linux terminal. But starting with the last race I couldn&#8217;t. But today I got great news. The official Formula 1 website just released a mobile version available at <a href="http://mobile.formula1.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile.formula1.com</a> and oh joy and happiness they also released a mobile application that will offer Live Timings on your mobile phone.

To my biggest surprise, my symbian based Nokia E71 is supported. I seriously awaited to only see android and iphone there because they are all the rage. I suppose it&#8217;s because Formula 1 is much more popular in europe. Anyways I have live timings on my phone for free now.

Also many more services are available for your phone for free &#8211; like sms text services &#8211; that I find very nice.

So have fun !
