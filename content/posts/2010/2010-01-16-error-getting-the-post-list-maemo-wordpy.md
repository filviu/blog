Today I tried again installing and configuring WordPy for Maemo on my Nokia N800 internet tablet. Since I can blog from my mobile phone I wanted to have a wordpress blog client on my tablet as well.

I configured everything correctly but I kept getting the `_Error getting the post list` message everytime I wanted to refresh the posts list. I browsed the forum, tried everything than  I realized the only difference between configurations posted on the forum and mine: `http://` was missing from my Blog URL field in the configuration.

That is all that was needed. The post list appeared and I can now post from my Nokia Internet Tablet too. Actually I could do it for a long time, since WordPy is available from the times of the 770 tablet.

Have fun.
