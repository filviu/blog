Being and old time Maemo fan I went and preordered the Jolla phone as soon as I could (March 2013 IIRC) and I've been happily playing with it ever since I got it. I like to play the occasional game on the go and so I bought many of the bundles that humblebundle offered. Happily they also offer an android application that functions like a store - you can see all the games you bought and download/install/update them. Follow [these directions to install the Humble Bundle][1] app.

Read bellow is a list of the games I own and as I get time to test them I will update the status.
