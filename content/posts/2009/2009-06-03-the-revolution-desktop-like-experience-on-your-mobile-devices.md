Everytime a new mobile devices comes around or a new browser is announced all the news sites and blogs happily announce a revolution: the _desktop like_ browsing experience on a mobile device. I remember when I researched a few reviews before buying my Nokia E71 phone that some reviewers complained about the qvga resolution of the device.

I can only say this cow bagles !

First of all there&#8217;s no way that you can cram the 19&#8221; plus experience of a normal desktop monitor on a 2.5 &#8211; 3.5 inches screen. No way, no matter how fast the device is it will never be the same. To the resolution I can only say that I already wear glasses, I don&#8217;t need a freaking microscope when using my phone. Common 640&#215;480 on a 2.4&#8221; screen ? How out of reach with the real world can you be to write this crap in a review?

Even if one day you can stuff a 2 Ghz CPU and 1680&#215;1050 pixels all in a nice mobile phone with a ~3&#8221; screen you&#8217;ll need a microscope to be able to browse the web. So, untill the phone will beam the image directly into your brain you are still stuck with either zooming, either panning &#8211; this is what the physical world dictates ! So next time you see the revolution announced just do what I do &#8211; ignore it.

I&#8217;m not saying that there isn&#8217;t a good evolution in mobile browsers &#8211; heck I can browse pretty much any website on the default browser of the E71 and I can watch most streaming video sites using Skyfire &#8211; just saying that I won&#8217;t have my hone 20&#8221; screen experience in my pocket any time soon.
