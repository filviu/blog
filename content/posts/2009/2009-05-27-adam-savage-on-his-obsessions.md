    Ok so this might be old news for you, after all the video is from Dec. 2008 but I still find it extremely interesting, especially for the ones that only know Adam Savage as the guy goofing around on mythbusters.

<span id="t_47080">Be Creative, experiment. It inspired me to brush up my <em>creative projects</em> folder. I really find that Adam once started is hard to stop. His insight into problem solving is also very interesting. Anyways, just watch it and comment. I bet that, if you are into building or tinkering with stuff you will like it too!</span>
