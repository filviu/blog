The current state of browsers available for the Symbian operating system are a proof that there isn&#8217;t such thing as a _**one size fits all**_._ ****_You have the default browser, opera mobile, opera mini, skyfire and some others. I have installed on my e71 nokia phone Opera Mobile 10 beta, Skyfire and of course the default browser.

I tried to settle on using just one but I just couldn&#8217;t. If I want to watch some flash video online or browse a really heavy site Skyfire is really the only option.

For browsing mobile sites or sites that fit enough on the small display I still prefer the default Web browser because I don&#8217;t have to zoom.

For others I like Opera 10 Mobile because you have a nice bookmarks page, it&#8217;s snappy and looks good.

That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t really get the browser wars found around the forums and the internet. Having the choice is great. The only way to get decent video and performance of heavy sites it&#8217;s trough a proxy based browser so this is where Skyfire fits. On the other hand I don&#8217;t like trusting 3rd parties with my passwords so for private pages I use the default web browser. For some pages Opera is faster and more confortable.

As always YMMV so be sure to give them a try.
