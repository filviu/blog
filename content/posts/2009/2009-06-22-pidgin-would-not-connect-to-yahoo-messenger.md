I run pidgin on my windows machines because, I basically hate the bloat of the official Yahoo Messenger and because I also need google talk. For a few days I could not connect to Yahoo. Going to **Manage Accounts (CTRL+A) -> your problem yahoo account -> Advanced** and changing the server to `cn.scs.msg.yahoo.com` solved the problem for me.

Another reason to hate Yahoo, yet people seem to love it, and I need a way to chat with them too.

Update: [Pidgin 2.5.7](http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog) seems to solve this problem.<br /> </span>
