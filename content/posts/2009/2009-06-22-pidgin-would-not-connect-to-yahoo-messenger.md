I run pidgin on my windows machines because, I basically hate the bloat of the official Yahoo Messenger and because I also need google talk. For a few days I could not connect to Yahoo. Going to **Manage Accounts (CTRL+A) -> your problem yahoo account -> Advanced** and changing the server to **<span style="font-size: x-small">cn.scs.msg.yahoo.com </span>**<span style="font-size: x-small">solved the problem for me.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small">Another reason to hate Yahoo, yet people seem to love it, and I need a way to chat with them too.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: x-small">Update: <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pidgin 2.5.7</a> seems to solve this problem.<br /> </span>
