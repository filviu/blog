Finally, after years of putting it away, after a few design changes and a fried motherboard I have a linux jukebox. Well, not a jukebox but more an internet radio.

**Check at the bottom for the latest updates.**

When I first had the ideea I noticed an old ~ '50s Blaupunkt Radio my father had in his basement. I investigated if the radio was worth restoring but the inside was rusted, the capacitors were long gone and most of the tubes were missing. It was more a case of rebuilding rather than restoring. I checked around the internet and saw that many models like this one existed, so it was not rare. And so, the radio was gutted and the insides went away. I cleaned and repaired the case as best as I could.

The first ideea was to have a big harddrive inside, an amp and external speakers hooked to it. It worked like this for a while until the motherboard I used fried and so did the amp. The project was eventualy put aside.

Anyways recently, I aquired an old Pentium III Compaq. By the case I could swear it was a small motherboard. It was NOT, and also the custom compaq psu had very short wires, but I managed to fit it inside. Since I have a media center pc hooked to the tv and the surround with all the music on it I decided to change the original ideea and make it what it originally was: a radio.

So, I gutted an old set of very good sounding Altec Lansing computer speakers and installed the small amp and speakers inside. I also mounted the motherboard and psu inside. One small fan on a side does the job of cooling everything down. I use one of the buttons on the front for the amp and another one for the computer.

I gave up the harddrive from the original design for a compact flash <-> ide adapter and the system now boots from a 4 Gb compact flash card. I think I could have squeezed everything on a smaller card but I decided to do all the compiling in place and since cards are cheap I went for a big one. The adapter has space for a second card and, if I want I can fit a second, bigger card, to hold some music.

I have a usb numpad for control and the [usb lcd display][2] featured some time ago on this site for display.

Software:

  * <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpd</a> for playback
  * <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpc</a> for mpd control
  * <a href="http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lcdproc</a> and [lcd-stuff][3] for usb lcd display
  * <a href="http://www.burghardt.pl/tag/keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esekeyd</a> for numpad control
  * a bunch of bash scripts to glue everything in place

I hit a few problems:

  * Event Music Player Client daemon does not work, at least with my keypad. So I had to use an external daemon - esekeyd with mpc to control mpd.
  * lcd-stuff does not display the Name tag (that would be the radio station name, just the artist and track name. Fortunately it has a configuration tag to use as a title for the screen - on every playlist change a bashscript modifies that configuration setting to reflect the radio station's name and reloads lcd-stuff - it's ugly but it works.
  * I didn't find a way to save .pls and .m3u files and have them recognized by the mpd database. So a script is called at boot time (and also can be started from one of the keys on the keypad) to generate a playlist of the radio stations. Control is easy after that, it's a matter of play/stop, next / prev
  * I wanted to have a way to shut down the system safely from the keypad. OTOH I didn't want shutting down every time I hit the wrong key. But esekeyd doesn't support combinations. So I had ***** create a file, **/** create a second one but only if the first file (created by *) existed and on backspace press verify if the two files exist and if yes poweroff.

I'll post soon more photos, the insides and the configuration files and bash scripts used.

**2011 Update**

It never functioned reliably and so I decided on rebuilding it once more ðŸ™‚

  * The Compaq Deskpro EN was reassembled and donated to charity.
  * I bought the cheapest intel motherboard with an atom processor.
  * With the motherboard I also bought a small, slim PSU which happened to have the loudest annoying fan I ever heard. Fortunately the motherboard and disk use small amounts of power so no heat is produced. I hooked the fan to 5v and now it's quiet.
  * I got a good deal on a pair of Microlab powered speakers (were the last in stock, open box) so I hooked those up to the radio. It's still possible to use the insternal speakers but why would you want to ðŸ™‚
  * Used a 500Gb sata disk that I also had around.
  * Took the oportunity to update slackware, mpd and everything else to the latest versions.
  * Took out the LCD until I can find time to build it in a nice case
  * The usb numpad is still there but I'm having trouble finding a daemon that actually works between two reboots
  * I use Client175 for web control and also Sonata on n800 and DroidMPD on my wife's tablet to control it. Having 500Gb it's got it's music back (not only internet radio).
  * Since playlist support seems to be better now I have each radio stored in a playlist that DroidMPD or Client175 can simply load.
  * The best thing is that there are no custom hackish scripts left that could break all the time. It's just stock mpd, playlists and the clients. Oh, I also have the command line clients installed for when I ssh into it using my n900.
  * The only problematic thing left is the shitty usb wi-fi adapter I use (don't know, might be the drivers) it's slow and sometimes connection drops. I added **ping -c1 GATEWAY_IP** in cron every 2 minutes and this seems to help.

Somebody in the comments asked for the configurations and scriptsÂ  The original ones, from the compact flash should still be in backups somewhere but I don't see how they could help, as they point to old or discontinued versions.Â  (lcd-stuff comes to mind). The configuration I use now is as stock as one can get with mpd. Let me know if you have questions about it and also **_please_** recommend me a daemon that can listen for keystrokes from the usb keypad and it's stable.

Have fun.
