Another nice little app. Having started this site, I wondered if it is possible to update my blog from my mobile phone. (Nokia E71). Well, WordPress does offer the option to post by email but I didn&#8217;t find that option too appealing. So a few google searches after I found [Scribe][1] and [Wordmobi][2]. Both are nice symbian mobile blogging tools. I chose Wordmobi because of the more beefier feature set, suport for the Python 1.9.5 released today &#8211; that means more active development. I can write, edit and delete posts, moderate comments and much more. I really like it. It feels fast and responsive. You can choose between a version for Python 1.4 and python 1.9. Have fun mobile blogging !

As a fun ending: I also found a commercial software, Wavelog I think was the name, that I couldn&#8217;t even get up and running &#8211;Â  it just kept hanging. I guess open source proves its self once again.
