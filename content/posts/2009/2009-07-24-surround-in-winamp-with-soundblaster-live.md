I had some time last night and I wanted to listen to some music. I have a pc hooked to my tv and my surround system. I realized that I can only hear music in the front speakers. It took some time to find how to enable 5.1 sound using winamp and my creative soundblaster live. Long story short I had to **install Creative PlayCenter** (I didn't install all the bloat of the creative drivers before) and start PlayCenter and **enable CMSS**. After that you can close PlayCenter and CMSS is still enabled. (CMSS transforms stereo sound in full surround). It sounds pretty good.

Have fun.
