Although I do most of my work on a computer, I need from time to time to draw schematics, plans and so on. And for that I like to use millimeter graph paper. And I also like to print my own. So I made for myself a couple of PDF files with a graph paper template and I decided to share them with you.

**Note:** when printing make sure that you set Page scaling to none, otherwise the paper will come out wrong.

There are no markings, credits or links on the pages, just plain millimetric graph paper.

_Although these files are free from marks I still want credit for them, so if you want them on your site please link to this post._
