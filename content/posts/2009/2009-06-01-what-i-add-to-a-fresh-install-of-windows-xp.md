Yes, yes, I know, Windows 7 is all the rage today. But, XP is still widely used and for now is the operating system I need to install on 90% of the cases.  
Of course first I install Windows XP, then the pc&#8217;s drivers and utilities, then I add whatever commercial software the client uses. After that, from case to case I always add some of the following:

## Security

  * If it&#8217;s a home user that doesn&#8217;t have a paid antivirus solution I install **AVG free or Avast Home** edition. Both are, in my opinion, _good enough_ security sollutions if the user is careful, and is not browsing _the darker side of the Internet._
  * A business user would have his/her paid security suite

## Utilities

  * <a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Unlocker</strong></a> &#8211; a free utility that reports the process that is holding a file open. Good for those &#8220;Cannot delete file: Access is denied&#8221;, &#8221; There has been a sharing violation.&#8221;, &#8221; The source or destination file may be in use.&#8221;, &#8221; The file is in use by another program or user.&#8221;, &#8220;Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&#8221; messages.
  * <a href="http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start-up</a> control panel applet. It&#8217;s an applet that gives easy access to programs and services started by windows on boot. I use it to remove those pesky &#8220;Adobe Reader Speed-up&#8221; and so on.
  * Adobe acrobat reader
  * Flash Player

## Graphics

  * Almost everybody has pictures on his/her computer be it a business machine or a home pc. <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irfan View</a> it&#8217;s a great option for viewing and basic cropping, editing and resizing jobs.
  * For more advanced users with a lot of pictures I install <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picasa</a>.
  * For even more advanced user I install <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The GiMP</a>.
  * Some users need vector graphics capabilities and for them I install <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inkscape</a>.

## Multimedia

  * If the user wants videos on his machine there is really only one easy way: <a href="http://www.videolan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoLAN</a>. Advanced video player, with built in codecs for every video file you can imagine !
  * <a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winamp</a> for music. It might not be what it used to be, but it&#8217;s what everybody knows and is used to.

## Internet

  * <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla firefox</a>. I really think Internet Explorer is a big problem. If the user has some banking or special site that requires IE, I make a custom shortcut for it on the desktop and make Firefox the default.
  * Should the user need ftp I install <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FileZilla</a>.

## Other

  * [Google Earth][1]. Some of my clients are real estate agencies, and google earth is very handy for them.
