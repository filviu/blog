Yes, yes, I know, Windows 7 is all the rage today. But, XP is still widely used and for now is the operating system I need to install on 90% of the cases.
Of course first I install Windows XP, then the pc's drivers and utilities, then I add whatever commercial software the client uses. After that, from case to case I always add some of the following:

## Security

  * If it's a home user that doesn't have a paid antivirus solution I install **AVG free or Avast Home** edition. Both are, in my opinion, _good enough_ security sollutions if the user is careful, and is not browsing _the darker side of the Internet._
  * A business user would have his/her paid security suite

## Utilities

  * [Unlocker](http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/) - a free utility that reports the process that is holding a file open. Good for those "Cannot delete file: Access is denied", " There has been a sharing violation.", " The source or destination file may be in use.", " The file is in use by another program or user.", "Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use." messages.
  * [Start-up](http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml) control panel applet. It's an applet that gives easy access to programs and services started by windows on boot. I use it to remove those pesky "Adobe Reader Speed-up" and so on.
  * Adobe acrobat reader
  * Flash Player

## Graphics

  * Almost everybody has pictures on his/her computer be it a business machine or a home pc. [Irfan View](http://www.irfanview.com/) it's a great option for viewing and basic cropping, editing and resizing jobs.
  * For more advanced users with a lot of pictures I install [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/).
  * For even more advanced user I install [The GiMP](http://www.gimp.org/).
  * Some users need vector graphics capabilities and for them I install [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/).

## Multimedia

  * If the user wants videos on his machine there is really only one easy way: [VideoLAN](http://www.videolan.org/). Advanced video player, with built in codecs for every video file you can imagine !
  * [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com) for music. It might not be what it used to be, but it's what everybody knows and is used to.

## Internet

  * [Mozilla firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/). I really think Internet Explorer is a big problem. If the user has some banking or special site that requires IE, I make a custom shortcut for it on the desktop and make Firefox the default.
  * Should the user need ftp I install [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/).

## Other

  * [Google Earth][1]. Some of my clients are real estate agencies, and google earth is very handy for them.
