Even though I like Gravity a lot, I chose a simpler FREEWARE symbian native application as a client for Twitter &#8211; <a href="http://www.tweets60.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweets60</a>:

It&#8217;s simple, fast, and has access point prioritization built in.

It may not be as feature full as Gravity, but it&#8217;s free &#8211; so you can&#8217;t argue there. You can write your tweets, follow others and click links and more. Even more I find it faster than Gravity. Of course if you need or want to be able to upload pictures and other advanced features that Tweet60 misses for now you&#8217;ll need to shell out the (modest) price of Gravity.

Have fun twittering !
