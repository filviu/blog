I&#8217;m a geek, that means I like Star Trek. That also means that I watched the latest Star Trek movie as soon as it was possible. I didn&#8217;t have many expectations. Nemesis was a bit of a disapointment, and with everything new and changed I just went to see it. I was pleasently surprised. I found it to be a good movie. A bit different from what I call Star Trek.

Like the line said &#8211; _Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed._ Abrams took a break from everything we knew. Every little detail we knew about the Star Trek world is broken. That, on one side, gives the producers the freedom to create a new Star Trek world for the current generations. On the other hand it&#8217;s a bit hard to digest for an old trekie like myself. I invested a lot of time to know, learn and imagine all the events in the Star Trek universe, it&#8217;s not nice for somebody to come and tell me to forget everything !

Another good thing is the music. I found it great. I listened to the sound track, and I can say that it&#8217;s very, very good.Â  Especially Labor of Love. If you haven&#8217;t yet, I suggest you go out and buy the soundtrack and listen to it &#8211; loud !

All in all, I&#8217;m happy that the franchise is back, and with a good movie. Even if it lacks the atmosphere I expect from trek movies, at least is good and worth watching.
