![easypic5" alt="easypic5](/blog/images/2009/easypic5.jpg) Not that I'm not happy with the default mikroC library for the KS0108 graphic displays, as I always I wanted something with the source available. Considering that I'm a beginner with microcontrolers having the source available to hack around is a very valuable learning tool.

The project is based on the source found here:

[http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/](http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/)

The source is made pretty universal, still it took some work and modifications to have it working in mikroC. The archive is a ready working project for mikroC.

I tested and developed it on the EasyPIC5 development board with a PIC16F887 microcontroller. You have to have the boardÂ  configured for the touchscreen panel and GLCD display - i suppose you know how to do that, if not you should consult the EasyPIC5 manual.

The project has everything you need:

  * a small demo program that uses text and bitmaps so you can see how the touchscreen, graphics, images and text work
  * a font file
  * a file to host your bitmap data
  * graphic functions
  * ks0108 functions
  * microcontroller dependent functions.

Yyou can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/filviu/ks0108_lib)
