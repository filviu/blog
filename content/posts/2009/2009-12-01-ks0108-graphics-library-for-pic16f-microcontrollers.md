Considering that I'm a beginner with microcontrolers having the source available to hack around is a very valuable learning tool.

The project is based on the source found here:

<a href="http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/</a>

The source is made pretty universal, still it took some work and modifications to have it working in mikroC. The archive is a ready working project for mikroC.

I tested and developed it on the EasyPIC5 development board with a PIC16F887 microcontroller. You have to have the boardÂ  configured for the touchscreen panel and GLCD display - i suppose you know how to do that, if not you should consult the EasyPIC5 manual.

The project has everything you need:

  * a small demo program that uses text and bitmaps so you can see how the touchscreen, graphics, images and text work
  * a font file
  * a file to host your bitmap data
  * graphic functions
  * ks0108 functions
  * microcontroller dependent functions.

[Download everything HERE][1]. Or you could find the code on [GitHub][2].
