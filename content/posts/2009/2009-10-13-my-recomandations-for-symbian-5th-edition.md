But my wife&#8217;s had it with her old 7610 so we upgraded her phone. After some deliberation, and her not liking the design of the e55 and e52 she finally settled for a Nokia 5800.

As you know that&#8217;s a 5th edition, touchscreen phone. I was a bit reticent because it&#8217;s never a good idea to get the first product from a series (that being the first Nokia touchscreen), still after reading a few reviews getting the 5800 seemed like a good idea. She doesn&#8217;t write that much and so missing a keyboard is no problem for her.

There are probably 1001 reviews online so I&#8217;m not getting into that, and there are enough top 10 freeware and top 10 shareware lists too. I&#8217;ll just list the software that I found useful for her and working on the 5800:

  * <a href="http://www.fring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fring </a>&#8211; not using voip that much, but it&#8217;s great for consolidated IM-ing (yahoo, google talk and skype)
  * Facebook &#8211; the iphone interface works great. I tried Symabook but it&#8217;s slow and unstable
  * Garmin Mobile XT &#8211; wonderful on the wide screen. My wife travels a lot as a professional interpreter so a GPS application comes handy. Using nokia maps on a roaming connection is not really an option, and the Garmin maps seem the best around.
  * Accuweather applet &#8211; looks good, shows the weather.
  * FreeUnRar

Still to come:

  * Quickoffice.  I&#8217;ve been spoiled with the E series devices especially since the latest offer QuickOffice 6 is free.
  * Skyfire &#8211; still not working on 5th edition but it&#8217;s been promised for some time now.
