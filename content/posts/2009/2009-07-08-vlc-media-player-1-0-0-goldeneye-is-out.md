Traditionally 1.0 would be a complete, stable release. Well VideoLAN is there. Actually has been there for some time, I use it constantly and besides an uglier than usual interface has been stable and useful for me.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know VideoLAN is a full featured Media Player for Windows, Linux, OSX and many more operating systems. VLC 1.0.0 has support for live recording, new HD codecs (including Blu-ray and AES3), new formats, new encoders, and many other new features.
