![grokking_the_gimp](/blog/images/2009/grokking_the_gimp-300x300.jpg) Since we were talking [Grokking the Gimp](http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html) is a free book by Carey Bunks. It's an advanced book covering A LOT of what you can do with Gimp.

For any of you who are at least a little bit interested in graphics Gimp should already be on your radar. I know that Adobe Photoshop is more advanced, but I also realized working with both that for at least 90% of the tasks (and for my webdesign and graphics design needs 100%) is good enough.
