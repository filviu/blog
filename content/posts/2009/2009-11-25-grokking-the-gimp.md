You probably know about it but anyways: <a href="http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grokking the Gimp</a> is a free book by Carey Bunks. It&#8217;s an advanced book covering A LOT of what you can do with Gimp.

For any of you who are at least a little bit interested in graphics Gimp should already be on your radar. I know that Adobe Photoshop is more advanced, but I also realized working with both that for at least 90% of the tasks (and for my webdesign and graphics design needs 100%) is good enough.
