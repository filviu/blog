![book_with_cd](/blog/images/2009/book_with_cd.jpg) As you might have noticed from my posts I am always in for a free lunch.

So, this would be free lunch for your brain. Even if you don't use or plan to use Mikroelektronika products you might want to know that they have a free book about PIC microcontrolers on their website: [here](http://www.mikroe.com/en/books/picmcubook/).

It's not tied up to any of their development systems but it does focus on the PIC16F887, and even if the English used is not the best possible it still gets the job done.

It's a good read, especially for beginners. It has clear color diagrams, examples, schematics and much more. It's been really helpful for me.

Again, if you missed the link you can read the full book for free [here](http://www.mikroe.com/en/books/picmcubook/).
