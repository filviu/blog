Since I didn&#8217;t want to pay for a kit of precut and bent wires for a breadboard and I am also lazy enough to put up trying a few ideeas because it involves cutting wires, I looked around and found an easy way to make connections on a breadboard: staples!

Just use a stapler so that it dispenses the staples without bending them or a cutter (watch the fingers) to obtain individual staples.

Since staples come in many sizes it&#8217;s easy to prepare a nice kit that should cut down on the number of wires hanging off your breadboard. Just make sure the staple is not too thick to damage your breadboard.

Have fun !
