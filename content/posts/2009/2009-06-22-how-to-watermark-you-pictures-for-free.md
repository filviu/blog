Ever since I post pictures on the internet I searched for a way to watermark them. I am not paranoiac but I want others to respect my work. I used to use [Fast Stone Image Viewer](http://www.faststone.org/). It's fast, free for personal use and has an array of functions that can be applied in Batch Mode, many useful if you publish your pictures online.

Here's a quick step by step:

1. Start Fast Stone, select the images you want to watermark and press **F3**. The following window appears:

Either check and output folder, either check a rename scheme otherwise your originals would be overwritten. Click **Advanced**.

2. Click resize and check it. Choose a way and a size to resize your images. You have a lot of options. I usually do _**set long side to xxx pixels**_.

3.Click and check Text. Type your text, choose a font and position. Also, if you want you can make the text transparent.

4. Optional, you can set a frame, many options are available.

5. Click ok and hit Convert.

You can see after conversion all kinds of informations, like file size before and after, and so on.

Give it a try. It's great, I use it for this blog.
