I just stumbled upon a nice little utility. It&#8217;s called ATF Cleaner. What it does? What you always do when you clean up a computer or remove a virus: it cleans temporary folders, temporary internet files and so on. It&#8217;s what you basically do manually every time you start working on a computer with problems.

</p>

It&#8217;s small, fast and useful but as it&#8217;s always the case with utilities that erase files you should be careful. Also, according to it&#8217;s home page ATF Cleaner is just for windows XP.
