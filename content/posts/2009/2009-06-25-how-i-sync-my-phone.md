Like I said I used to have an Sony Ericsson phone that had Automatic Sync built in. Nokia has sync (SyncML) but no settings to automate that. I like the ideea of syncing a phone with an online service because it gives me access to my schedule and contacts on any pc I use without the need of additional software.

Some time ago I tried goosync, Scheduleworld and others promissing easy sync between a SyncML capable device (my phone) and Google Calendar. None proved satisfactory. Nokia started the Ovi online suite and I saw a bit of light. It works very well, you can send the configuration automatically to your phone and is all nicely integrated. I use Ovi to update my notes, calendar and contacts directly from a web browser. The only problem left was **automatisation**. Remembering to sync my device every time I changed something online was a bit tedious.

Thank you [swim][1]. Now my ovi sync profile is run every 4 hours (that seems to be enough for me). The only problem left is that, since Smart Connect is not working, I must set for Sync an access point that is always available - so mobile internet ap is the only choise. Still, syncing is not data intensive, still, if you are on an expensive plan you might want to monitor it.
