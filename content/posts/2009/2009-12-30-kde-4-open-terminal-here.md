When I was using KDE 3 I was pretty fond of the right click **Open Terminal Here** command. I was disapointed to see it gone in the latest incarnations of KDE . Until I stumbled upon dolphin's integrated terminal. All you have to do is hit F4 inside a folder and at the bottom of the file browser you'll have a nice and shiny terminal. You have to remember though - and this can be both useful and dangerous if you're not careful - that the cli current folder follows you around.Â  Also if you type a command and then enter a folder the command will try to execute that command, even if it's unfinished, so this is something to keep in mind.
