When I was using KDE 3 I was pretty fond of the right click **Open Terminal Here** command. I was disapointed to see it gone in the latest incarnations of KDE . Until I stumbled upon dolphin&#8217;s integrated terminal. All you have to do is hit F4 inside a folder and at the bottom of the file browser you&#8217;ll have a nice and shiny terminal. You have to remember though &#8211; and this can be both useful and dangerous if you&#8217;re not careful &#8211; that the cli current folder follows you around.Â  Also if you type a command and then enter a folder the command will try to execute that command, even if it&#8217;s unfinished, so this is something to keep in mind.
