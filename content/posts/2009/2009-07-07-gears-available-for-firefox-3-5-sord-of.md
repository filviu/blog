I don't need it for Gmail but I use the _**turbo**_ feature of WordPress.

Well, a good soul over at the Google Gears User Group made a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gears-users/msg/70f164020c0f8f4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom build</a>. You should treat it as beta quality. It works for me on Windows but YMMV.

Probably official support is right around the corner if the fix is already in the latest source. Common google !
