I gave up finding a nice theme for my E71 long ago. Even accepted the ugly icons. A few weeks ago I found a decent theme with ovi icons and got a bit happier. Today I had time to search a bit some more and I have some of the best Nokia E71 themes I found:

Ovi Blue from [Nokia Conversations](http://conversations.nokia.com/2009/02/26/heres-that-ovi-theme/)

Aviator, Enterprise and Zen Touch from [Tehkseven][1] - those are both with sevan and ovi icons.

**Zen Touch:**

**Enterprise:**

Ovi blue has screenshots if you follow the link above.

Have fun with your E71 that is no longer graphically chalanged.
