![book_with_cd](/blog/images/2009/book_with_cd.gif) Mikroelektronica, beign the nice guys they are released another free e-book about programming PIC microcontrollers this time it's about programming in C. The title is, unsurprisingly:

**PIC Microcontrollers - Programming in C**

> What are microcontrollers, anyway? Electronics built in one single chip capable of controlling a small submarine, a crane or an elevator… It’s up to you to decide what you want them to do and dump a program containing appropriate instructions into the chip.

_**Author:** Milan Verle_
