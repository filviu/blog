I'm a big fan of Virtualbox. It's easy, fast and free. Recently I had to revive an older Solaris guest that used to run under vmware, and to set it up to run under Virtualbox. I quickly found out that after the grub screen it enters a reboot loop and nothing seemed to help. I could boot into failsafe and mount the root partition as /a/

Someone suggested that the problem was that vmware had the disk as SCSI (c0t0d0s0) and virtualbox enumerated them as IDE (c0d0s0). I tried setting the disk on a virtual SCSI controller but it didn't help. I set it back to IDE and proceeded to inform Solaris of the new setup: (it takes a bit of tinkering, be sure to have a backup of the image)

1. Boot Solaris in safeboot (failsafe) It's usually the last option in Grub.
2. The original root partition should be found and mounted under /a Be sure to say y and mount it read-write. If you, like me, come from the Linux world running /usr/bin/bash will help you. Also export TERM=xterm will allow vi to run.
3. Move `/a/dev` `/a/devices` and `/a/etc/path_to_inst` to other names (rename them to .old or .orig or something)
```bash
mv /a/dev /a/dev.orig
mv /a/devices /a/devices.orig
mv /a/etc/path_to_inst /a/etc/path_to_inst
``` 
4. Run `devfsadm -r /a` to rebuild the devices folders
5. Now you will fix the boot disk path. Edit **/a/boot/solaris/bootenv.rc** using vi (oh joy) and fix the line that reads `setprop bootpath '/pci@0,0....` You will want the line to point to the same path as your disk points. Again if you come from Linux you will ask the same as me. Where the @#$% do I get this. Easy `ls -l /dev/dsk/c0d0s0` (or whatever device `df -k` says `/a` is mounted from. The same pci path, without `../../devices` needs to go at setprop bootpath. Save and exit.
6. Edit `/a/etc/vfstab` to match (here you will have `/dev/dsk/c0d0s0` or similar - see the beauty of this ? ðŸ™‚ )
7. Run `bootadm update-archive -v -R /a` to rebuild the boot archive on `/a`
8. Force to reconfigure on next boot `touch /a/reconfigure`
9. `cd /; sync; sync; sync; umount /a` Don't worry much if it won't unmount.
10. `init 6` to reboot

Have fun!
