I was installing today Zabbix on a CentOS 5.6 machine and hit the following error when trying to load the PHP Web Interface:

```bash
PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function bcscale() in /var/www/zabbix/include/defines.inc.php on line 797
```

The fix was one package install away:

```bash
yum -y install php-bcmath
```
