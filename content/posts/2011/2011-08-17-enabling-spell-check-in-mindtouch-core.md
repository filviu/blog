After an update the spell checker I was used to disappeared. Here's how to (re)enable the (new) spell checker:

Go to **Control Panel -> Configuration -> Basic ->** Tick _"Allow users to spell check while editing content"_ and hit Save

Go back to editing and you should see the icon with "ABC" and a checkmark.
