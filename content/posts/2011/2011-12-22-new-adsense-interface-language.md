Though not my native language I like all my software in English. It always sounds weird to me to see it different. Ever since AdSense upgraded the looks it switched to Romanian. Today I wanted to tackle this:

I went to **Home->Account settings->Display Language**

It was already **English US**

Well, it won't be the first webapp displaying a default that was there in the interface but not in the settings database.

So I clicked **EDIT** switched to English UK, hit **save** and then back to English US and **save** again.

It worked. QA was at lunch [again][1] for google.
