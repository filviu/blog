I have a secondary phone that is running Android. My main phone is still a Nokia N900 for which I gave up trying to sync contacts with gmail. Two options basically exist for n900 none of which works for me:

  1. using MFE which works from time to time
  2. use syncevolution which invariably screws my contacts on the n900 (I guess google's implementation of syncml or exchange support is dubious at best)

So I devised a third. Since I edit and store all my contacts on the n900 I will export them from time to time **(Contacts->Export->All contacts)Â ** and import them manually into gmail. **_Note that Gmail doesn't support vCard 3.0; you have to export as 2.1_**. Unfortunately the n900 will export each contact into a separate file. Since google doesn't offer bulk import support I thought of concatenating all files into one:

**cat *.vcf > all_contacts.vcf**

Good idea, but it doesn't work. In another example of fine programming skills clicking import uploads the file and returns with no contact imported and **no error message**. Nice one.

It seems some new lines are missing; and so this will work (in the folder with the vcf files)

```bash
for i in *.vcf; do cat "$i" >> ../all_contacts.vcf; echo >> ../all_contacts.vcf; done
```
Import worked now ok!

Update:

Here's courtesy of Adam A Johnson (in the comments below) how to do the same in Windows.

FOR %f IN (*.vcf) DO TYPE "%f" >> all_contacts.vcf & ECHO. >> all_contacts.vcf
