You probably already know this old, unmaintained but incredibly useful software:Â  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tentakel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tentakel</a>. If not check it out, you might like it.

There are two issues we need to tackle:

**1.** Tentakel uses tpg but the bundled version is not compatible with python 2.6

Error thrown:  
[cc_bash]return self.lexer[start:stop]  
TypeError: object cannot be interpreted as an index[/cc_bash]  
The fix is to download this version of tpg from it's developer: <a href="http://cdsoft.fr/tpg/TPG-3.1.2.tar.gz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://cdsoft.fr/tpg/TPG-3.1.2.tar.gz</a> _****_From this archive extract **tpg.py** and copy it to **py/lekatnet/plugins** in tentakel's source tree.

_**Don't try the latest TPG version as it will not work probably it's parameters changed and tentakel doesn't work.**_ ****Basically we take a version low enough to work with tentakel (the built in is from 2003) and new enough to work with Python 2.6

**2.** Hide the md5 deprecation warning. This is not essential but seeing the warning everytime is annoying. Edit **py/lekatnet/config.py** and add around line 49 (after """)  
Error shown:  
[cc_bash]/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/lekatnet/plugins/rsh.py:32: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead  
import md5[/cc_bash]  
It's just a warning but it might interfere with automated tasks:  
[cc_python]import warnings  
warnings.simplefilter("ignore", DeprecationWarning)[/cc_python]  
After that build and install accordingly to INSTALL

**3.** The site-packages are not copied in the right place (at least for CentOS 6) so move **/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/lekatnet** to **/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/lekatnet  
** 

Enjoy.

After that build and install accordingly to INSTALL
