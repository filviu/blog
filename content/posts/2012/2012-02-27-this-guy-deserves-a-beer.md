Chances are if you are a developer or a sysadmin you had to work with regular expressions. Well I hate them. With passion. So when I discovered this website I was jumping for joy:

Basically you type in your clear text and select what you want extracted (certain word, integers, dates) and as a bonus you also get back code already written. Of course you probably have to adapt that one.
