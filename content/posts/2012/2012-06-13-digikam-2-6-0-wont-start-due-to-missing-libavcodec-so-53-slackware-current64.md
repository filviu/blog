This was pretty simple but complicated :). It turns out I updated [alien bob](http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/)'s repo to ffmpeg 0.11, thus upgrading to libavcodec.so.54. I'm sure I could have gotten away with a simple symlink but I wanted a clean install.

So I though I would simply rebuild digikam, right? Wrong. It failed, with weird errors like:

```bash
make[2]: \*** [extra/libkface/test/detect] Error 1
```

or

```bash
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [extra/kipi-plugins/removeredeyes/test/testipp] Error 1
```

Face detect above sounded a lot like [digikam](http://digikam.org/) built successfully.
