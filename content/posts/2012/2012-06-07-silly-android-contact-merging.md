So, for now my beloved n900 is in the service dead, so I started organizing contacts on the Android phone I have. First thing I did was to merge contacts (for example joining Jon Doe&#8217;s contact from google-phonebook, facebook, skype and so on)

I&#8217;m used to doing this for years now as the old n900 but I noticed this strange behaviour with some of my frinds who use fake names /nicknames for skype or facebook, etc.

Say I join Jon Doe (google) with kingofrock1950 (on skype) sometimes it showed the real name other times the nickname. I tried searching for a setting or a way to change it but found none.

Here&#8217;s the (lack of) logic behind it:

  * If you choose Jon Doe and then select join **with** kingofrock1950 the name in the phone book will be the real name.
  * If you select kingofrock1950 and then join with Jon Doe the name shown will be kingofrock1950.

I find it extremely stupid that I can&#8217;t select the _default account_ which gives the name. Though you can select the picture. Fitting, all image, stupid functionality. Well&#8230;

If you have to fix it you need to _Separate contact_ and then join in the correct order. Nice, isn&#8217;t it?
