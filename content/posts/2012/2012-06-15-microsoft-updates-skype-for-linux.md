![skype for linux](/blog/images/2012/download-skype-2-2-beta-for-linux.jpg) Or in other news, hell froze over ðŸ™‚ Some people complained about the new interface, so I'll try to be agains the flow here and say that I actually quite like it.

It's not like skype for linux was ever active but since Microsoft aquired them I pretty much wrote off any updates. It seems I, like many others was wrong. Probably it has something to do with the new advertising features introduced lately...

Go to [skype linux](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/linux/) page and get it. <del>Don't worry if it still says 2.2 beta, the download buttons will get you the new package.</del> The page was updated, it says 4.0 now.

If, like me, you were happy seeing 64 bit versions don't worry, it's still a 32 bit binary but with multilib dependencies for the package.

Also worth noting that I run latest slackware current64 with Alien Bob's multilib packages and this skype version appears to be running just fine.
