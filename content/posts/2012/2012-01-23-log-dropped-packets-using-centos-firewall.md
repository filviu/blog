Please take care modifying your firewall. If you don't understand what's being done here you may lock yourself out of your machine. You've been warned ðŸ™‚ !

In order to log dropped packets on the INPUT chain I replaced this:  
[cceN_bash]  
-A INPUT -i eth0 -j REJECT -reject-with icmp-host-prohibited  
[/cceN_bash]  
with this  
[cce_bash]  
-N LOGDROP  
-A LOGDROP -i eth0 -j LOG  
-A LOGDROP -i eth0 -j REJECT -reject-with icmp-host-prohibited  
-A INPUT -i eth0 -j LOGDROP  
[/cce_bash]  
Of course you can use DROP instead of REJECT -reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
