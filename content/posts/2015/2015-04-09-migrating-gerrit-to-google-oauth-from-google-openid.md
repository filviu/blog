I expect this post to be obsolete pretty soon, but for now I expect this will help you skip many of the issues and questions I had going forward with upgrading Gerrit and switching to Google OAuth from OpenID.

This post is not exhaustive, I trust that you are familiar with Gerrit if you&#8217;ve come so far. I am running a gerrit installation that was stuck at v2.10 as all our users used Google OpenID. With OpenID being retired in a few weeks it was imperative to find a sollution and I really wanted to go with Google OAuth (so we don&#8217;t have to recreate/merge all our users by hand). The Gerrit developers bounced around the fixes up until the last minute (IMHO) as only 2.10.2 supports the gerrit-oauth-provider plugin out of the box without the need of cherry picked changes.

is required reading and fun to read and see how a thing like this can take a year of missed commits, approvals, etc. ðŸ™‚ Why gerrit refuses to have built in user management like any other half-sane web app around is beyond me but happily beyond the goal of this post too.

Let&#8217;s try to organize what you have to do in steps:

  1. Shut down gerrit and update to 2.10.2 or newer, see [here][1].
  2. Clone the [gerrit repository][2], checkout v2.10.2 (or same version as above) and build with buck.&nbsp;**Use gerrit buck**&nbsp;as they seem to differ from facebook buck, see [gerrit build instructions][3].
  3. Clone [gerrit-oauth-provider][4] inside /plugins (per [build.md][5] instructions, [those are supposed to be valid][6] and at the time of writing this building stand-alone might or might not work) and build it with buck. Add gerrit-oauth-provider.jar in your site&#8217;s plugins/ folder.
  4. [Create your google project][7]&nbsp;by visiting the [Google Developer Console][8] and obtain api and client secrets, per documentation or wiki.
  5. Following the [cci\_bash]java -jar gerrit.war init -d site/[/cci\_bash] to reconfigure the client-secret is added to [cci\_bash]site/etc/secure.config[/cci\_bash]&nbsp;[but for now it doesn&#8217;t work][9], it has to be in [cci\_bash]gerrit.config[/cci\_bash] under the plugin configuration.
  6. Trust the OpenID accounts by adding \[cci\_bash]trustedOpenID=^.*$[/cci\_bash] to the [cci\_bash\]\[auth\][/cci\_bash] section. See [this issue][10].
  7. You&nbsp;**must** keep the same URL otherwise automatic linking of OpenID<=>OAuth accounts doesn&#8217;t happend and you end up with new users that have to be merged ([painfully especially if you use mysql][11] as the documentation is [limited to postgress][12]).
  8. Pray, start gerrit, pray some more. Preferably to the [Spaghetti Monster][13].

It might be that some steps are not actually needed because due to&nbsp;confusing or downright missing documentation I had to scour mailing lists, github issues, gerrit commit logs&nbsp;and try each setting one by one until I got it working. When everything worked as expected I refused to go back and check whether some particular step (like building in tree, the need for trustedOpenID, etc.) is actually needed or it was already deprecated.

I&#8217;m pretty sure there are better ways to spend those hours.
