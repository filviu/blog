On one of my kde workstations I switched from firefox to chrome. One issue I found was that I have a custom script that takes magnet links and [adds them to my NAS server][1] instead of opening them locally. Chrome insisted on opening them with ktorrent instead of my custom script. The fix isÂ to create a file [cci\_bash]torrent.sh.desktop[/cci\_bash] inside [cci\_bash]~/.local/share/applications/[/cci\_bash] with the following content:

[ccNe_bash]  
[Desktop Entry]  
Type=Application  
Exec=/usr/local/bin/torrent.sh %u  
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/magnet;  
Name=torrent.sh  
Icon=  
NoDisplay=true  
[/ccNe_bash]

After that run [cci\_bash]kbuildsycoca4[/cci\_bash]
