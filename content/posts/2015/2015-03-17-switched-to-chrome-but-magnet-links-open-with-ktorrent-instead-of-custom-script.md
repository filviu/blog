On one of my kde workstations I switched from firefox to chrome. One issue I found was that I have a custom script that takes magnet links and [adds them to my NAS server][1] instead of opening them locally. Chrome insisted on opening them with ktorrent instead of my custom script. The fix isÂ to create a file `torrent.sh.desktop` inside `~/.local/share/applications/` with the following content:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/usr/local/bin/torrent.sh %u
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/magnet;
Name=torrent.sh
Icon=
NoDisplay=true
```

After that run:
```bash
kbuildsycoca4
```
