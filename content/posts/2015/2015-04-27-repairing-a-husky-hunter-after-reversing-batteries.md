Ok, I did it. For the first time since I remember I inserted batteries&nbsp;wrongly and reversed polarity. And that in a device I&#8217;m pretty fond of, and I recently aquired: a [Husky Hunter][1].&nbsp;It was only for a few seconds before I realized my mistake but it was enough, the computer was dead. I tried leaving it overnight with fresh batteries thinking that my mistake instantly depleted the onboard RAM battery (if it&#8217;s empty a Husky will just play dead until it gets a bit of charge). It didn&#8217;t work. Time to open it (again; the first time was for cleaning and inspection)

I was in luck, close to the battery compartment was a fuse. The multimeter quickly confirmed, it was interrupted.&nbsp;I began to hope that it did it&#8217;s job quick and the rest of the electronics would be fine.

I replaced (actually soldered along side it) a 1 ohm resistor (didn&#8217;t have any 0 ohm around and I hope that the small wattage resistor will act as a fuse if I&#8217;m that stupid to repeat my mistake.&nbsp;It is not a proper repair, next time I order parts, I&#8217;ll be sure to order a new fuse with the correct rating. Happily the Husky is back to life.
