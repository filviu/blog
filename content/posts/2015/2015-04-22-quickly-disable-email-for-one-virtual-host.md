If you discover that one site that you host is sendingÂ tons of emails there is an easy and quick way to disable email only for one particular virtual host. Add the following line in it's virtual host or .httacess file

 ```apacheconf
php_admin_value sendmail_path "/dev/null"
```

If you add it to the virtual host be sure to reload apache.
