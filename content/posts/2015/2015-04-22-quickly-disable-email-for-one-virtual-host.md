If you discover that one site that you host is sendingÂ tons of emails there is an easy and quick way to disable email only for one particular virtual host. Add the following line in it&#8217;s virtual host or .httacess file

[cci\_bash]php\_admin\_value sendmail\_path &#8220;/dev/null&#8221;[/cci_bash]

If you add it to the virtual host be sure to reload apache.
