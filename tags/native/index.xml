It&amp;rsquo;s simple, fast, and has access point prioritization built in.
It may not be as feature full as Gravity, but it&amp;rsquo;s free - so you can&amp;rsquo;t argue there. You can write your tweets, follow others and click links and more. Even more I find it faster than Gravity. Of course if you need or want to be able to upload pictures and other advanced features that Tweet60 misses for now you&amp;rsquo;ll need to shell out the (modest) price of Gravity.</description></item></channel></rss>
