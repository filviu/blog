While I was rebuilding my HP N40L Microserver storage to use new drives and ZFS I experienced very slow (&amp;lt;20MB/s ) First I thought that it was because the source was a degraded RAID5 and performance was lost due to parity. But when the target was a network share instead of the local ZFS pool write speeds went to a more respectable 60-70MB/s.</description></item></channel></rss>
