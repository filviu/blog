It has one issue though, you can&amp;rsquo;t set a limit.
So a little code hacking is in order. Open modules/mod_related_items/helper.php and go to line 94 (right after the _Filter by language_ if_) and modify
$db&amp;gt;setQuery($query); to read:
$db-&amp;gt;setQuery($query,0,10); Of course you can change the limit from 10 with whatever you like.</description></item><item><title>Error noticed in Joomla site apache logs</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/10/27/error-noticed-in-joomla-site-apache-logs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2011 17:50:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/10/27/error-noticed-in-joomla-site-apache-logs/</guid><description>Browsing trough my web logs I found the following error in the apache error log of a Joomla site:
[Mon Oct 17 13:49:16 2011] [error] [client aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa] PHP Notice: Array to string conversion in aaa/libraries/joomla/html/parameter.php on line 83 One suggestion found online was:
Edit parameters.php and change the line 83 as follows:
Before:
if (trim( $data )) { After:
if ($data) { But modifying core joomla files isn&amp;rsquo;t such a hot idea as one user notices.</description></item><item><title>Make Joomla 1.0 work with PHP 5.3</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/06/23/make-joomla-1-0-work-with-php-5-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 10:43:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/06/23/make-joomla-1-0-work-with-php-5-3/</guid><description>With the recent posts regarding resurrecting old stuff, recently I had to resurrect a Joomla 1.0 site. Soon enough I discovered that the home page doesn&amp;rsquo;t display correctly. No errors, just lots of white space :). The problem is that Joomla 1.0 is not really made for PHP 5.3. Of course I could have started a virtual machine with the right environment but I wanted it running along some newer sites.</description></item><item><title>Updated Joomla Flowplayer plug-in</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/09/10/updated-joomla-flowplayer-plug-in/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2010 16:42:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/09/10/updated-joomla-flowplayer-plug-in/</guid><description>I use flowplayer for joomla quite often. I usually use this plugin:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/multimedia/multimedia-players/video-players-a-gallery/7377
Unfortunately it uses an old version of flowplayer. So, since both are GPL I decided to update the plugin and share it.
You can download it here: plg_upd_flowplayer_J15_v1-1-0</description></item><item><title>How to recover a lost Joomla admin password</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/12/18/how-to-recover-a-lost-joomla-admin-password/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2009 19:32:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/12/18/how-to-recover-a-lost-joomla-admin-password/</guid><description>I administer a few Joomla sites so from time to time I discover that I lost the admin password for the one I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had to update for a long time. There is no way to find out what that password was because they are stored as a one way MD5 but since I usually use random characters anyway I reset the password with a new one. For that you need access to the mysql database of that Joomla site.</description></item><item><title>New menu items donâ€™t appear in Joomla 1.5.14</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/03/new-menu-items-dont-appear-in-joomla-1-5-14/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2009 10:27:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/03/new-menu-items-dont-appear-in-joomla-1-5-14/</guid><description>I was configuring a Joomla installation for a client today and stumbled upon this little problem. No matter how I tried, new menu items refused to appear. Not only in the front-end, but they were missing in the back-end too. I checked to see, but the PHP settings were all correct. Then I noticed that the WAMP installation used PHP 5.3.0. A quick look on the Joomla Forums confirmed that Joomla has problems with this version of PHP.</description></item><item><title>Custom csv export from virtuemart</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/04/custom-csv-export-from-virtuemart/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2009 09:11:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/04/custom-csv-export-from-virtuemart/</guid><description>One of my clients needed a custom feed of his virtuemart products. I did a quick google check and nothing came up, so I decided to write my own.
