Linux (usually slackware) + windows (first &amp;lsquo;98 than, as soon as it was available XP). Windows 98 was problematic because it needed frequent reinstalling, pleasently overwriting the boot sector everytime requiring in turn to reinstall lilo.
Than XP solved this problem (not that it didn&amp;rsquo;t quietly overwrite the boot sector) by needing far less frequent reinstalls. When I found out about vmware I was very happy, dual boot seemed a thing of the past.</description></item></channel></rss>
