I decided to use the DNS::ZoneParse perl module for convenience.
The example there is straightforward for changing MX records so I thought modifying it to change an A record should be a piece of cake. Right? Wrong!
For the love of it I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get my code to modify the record in question, it would always delete it.</description></item><item><title>Akismet troubles traced back to DNS issues.</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/06/02/akismet-troubles-traced-back-to-dns-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 05:50:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/06/02/akismet-troubles-traced-back-to-dns-issues/</guid><description>My API key for Akismet was suddenly unconfirmed by reason of not being able to reach akismet.com My provider had indeed troubles with their primary DNS so I switched to the google public one. (8.8.8.8). This is a server not a browsing machine so I don&amp;rsquo;t have any privacy worries.
Long storry short, I changed the DNS and expected the problem to go away. Next day I was happy to find out that it didn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>PHP code misses DNS updates.</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/12/22/php-code-misses-dns-updates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2010 12:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/12/22/php-code-misses-dns-updates/</guid><description>Apache needs a full stop &amp;amp; start on DNS changes. While working on a test environment I noticed that php code was not finding new hosts. The hosts were served by an internal, private dns server which was configured as default in resolv.conf
Warning: file_get_contents(http://www.testdomain.com/webapp/file.php) [function.file-get-contents]: failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error in /var/www/htdocs/test.php on line 4 [root@jentlaibm01 manager]# cat test.php Ping was working so any other test I tried, the only part not resolving the newly added host was the php application.</description></item><item><title>List of open dns servers</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/01/16/list-of-open-dns-servers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2010 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/01/16/list-of-open-dns-servers/</guid><description>This is a growing list of Open DNS servers available around the world.
