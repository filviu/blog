wine uninstaller Trying to install still gave the same error and so I had to do some registry surgery (be sure to replace root with your username):
grep &amp;#34;with upgrade&amp;#34; ~/.wine/drive_c/users/root/Temp/EvernoteSetup.log [01/07/2014 14:23:18] Located product {C2EECB42-2C7F-11E3-8960-00163E98E7D0} with upgrade code {AE2C091E-CF5F-4e30-8659-D640E23A8B99}.</description></item></channel></rss>
