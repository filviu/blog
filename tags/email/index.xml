Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a full blown MTA I settled for ssmtp.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this setup applies to any debian box, not only the rPI.
sSMTP - Simple SMTP sSMTP is a simple MTA to deliver mail from a computer to a mail hub (SMTP server).</description></item><item><title>Email a list of updates from a Debian server.</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/09/28/email-a-list-of-updates-from-a-debian-server/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2012 12:49:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/09/28/email-a-list-of-updates-from-a-debian-server/</guid><description>Do you run remote servers? Me too.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good ideea to keep them up to date. On the other hand I don&amp;rsquo;t like automatic updates, something might break when you least want or expect it. So I prefer to be notified of updates and choose myself the moment when to apply them. Following is a nice script that sends an email of available updates on a Debian system.</description></item><item><title>Digitally signing email or documents.</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/02/01/digitally-signing-email-or-documents/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2011 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/02/01/digitally-signing-email-or-documents/</guid><description>What are email certificates used for? Email certificates provide the strongest levels of confidentiality and security for your electronic communications by allowing you to digitally sign and encrypt your mail and attachments. Encryption means that only your intended recipient will be able to read the mail while digitally signing allows them to confirm you as the sender and verify the message was not tampered with en route.

One of it&amp;rsquo;s jobs is to download via pop3 all the email from our Gmail accounts just in case the cloud goes puf :). For this job I used fetchmail to fetch the emails to local users on the machine. All nice and simple &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;d think.
The mail didn&amp;rsquo;t get delivered because sendmail complained about this error.</description></item></channel></rss>
