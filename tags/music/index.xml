Since it&amp;rsquo;s always on (as oposed to my nas) I decided to add some storage so I can host my music and some tv shows. I checked some projects and stopped to test Sockso.The site is simple and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scream &amp;ldquo;open source project&amp;rdquo; but sockso seems really good at what it does. It works both as a gui and as a server tool and is available for windows, linux and mac.</description></item><item><title>No album cover art in Symbian ^3 Belle on an E7</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/07/13/no-album-cover-art-in-symbian-3-belle-on-an-e7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:31:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/07/13/no-album-cover-art-in-symbian-3-belle-on-an-e7/</guid><description>Sooo, my beloved n900 kicked the bucket and the fine folks at Nokia Romania decided it&amp;rsquo;s not fixable and they replaced it. With an E7. After 6 weeks. Hey Nokia still wondering why you&amp;rsquo;re going down the drain?
I have my music neatly organized and with cover art embeded inside the id3tag. But it won&amp;rsquo;t show up. Actually it showed up for one album out of 15. So I started the hunt to see why.</description></item></channel></rss>
