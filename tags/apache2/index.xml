For that I use both a password and IP based restrictions. The issue is that for example at home I have a dynamic allocated IP. One option would be to add a hostname in the apache rule, like this:
Allow from example.dyndns.org But this has some disadvantages:
it requires a dns lookup on each access it uglifies your access logs To get around this I moved away from Access control to a rewrite map.</description></item><item><title>Apache2 mpm-itk maxclients settings</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/04/18/apache2-mpm-itk-maxclients-settings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 06:09:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/04/18/apache2-mpm-itk-maxclients-settings/</guid><description>I run the mpm-itk apache2 module on my server since it&amp;rsquo;s shared between a few sites. A few rogue crawlers brought it down a few days ago and while I was checking the logs I noticed a lot more apache children processes running than I had defined. One quick look in apache2.conf and I noticed my mistake. I had configured under a different prefork module since the default config shipping with debian has no section for itk.</description></item></channel></rss>
