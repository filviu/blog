Weird, but solvable. I ended doing the following:
Uninstall evernote:
wine uninstaller Trying to install still gave the same error and so I had to do some registry surgery (be sure to replace root with your username):
grep &amp;#34;with upgrade&amp;#34; ~/.wine/drive_c/users/root/Temp/EvernoteSetup.log [01/07/2014 14:23:18] Located product {C2EECB42-2C7F-11E3-8960-00163E98E7D0} with upgrade code {AE2C091E-CF5F-4e30-8659-D640E23A8B99}.</description></item><item><title>Tentakel on CentOS 6 / Python 2.6</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/09/11/tentakel-on-centos-6-python-2-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 10:25:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/09/11/tentakel-on-centos-6-python-2-6/</guid><description>Update: As useful as tentakel was in my young sysadmin days it was always dangerous (one wrong command or quote character away from disaster), non-reproducible, needing constant documentation on changes done. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know if tentakel even exist anymore but if it does I strongly suggest you consider ansible instead.
You probably already know this old, unmaintained but incredibly useful software:Â tentakel. If not check it out, you might like it.</description></item></channel></rss>
