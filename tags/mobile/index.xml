But starting with the last race I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. But today I got great news. The official Formula 1 website just released a mobile version available at mobile.formula1.com and oh joy and happiness they also released a mobile application that will offer Live Timings on your mobile phone.

I like having weather informations at hand. At home I have a nice mini weather station, but I still like to be able to check it on my phone. I tried a few apps before this one, even commercial ones like Handy Weather, still I find M!Weather - Mobile weather from the ubahnstation the best. [404 as of 2002] It&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s free and it&amp;rsquo;s acurate.</description></item></channel></rss>
