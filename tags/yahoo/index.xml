The virus, spreads via mass messaging the following message:
HAHA Michael Jackson Gay ðŸ˜€ &amp;raquo; http://looool.machiaeljack**ndied.com

For a few days I could not connect to Yahoo. Going to Manage Accounts (CTRL+A) -&amp;gt; your problem yahoo account -&amp;gt; Advanced and changing the server to cn.scs.msg.yahoo.com solved the problem for me.
Another reason to hate Yahoo, yet people seem to love it, and I need a way to chat with them too.</description></item></channel></rss>
