A comparison is found in this thread. (TL;DR arcfou256 is the fastest cipher).
Today I updated openssh on my slackware servers only to be greeted by this error from scripts doing rsync to my backup server:
no matching cipher found: client arcfour server aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [Receiver] rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.</description></item><item><title>Yahoo Messenger Michael Jackson virus</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/19/yahoo-messenger-michael-jackson-virus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2009 09:59:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/19/yahoo-messenger-michael-jackson-virus/</guid><description>A friend of mine got infected via Yahoo Messenger.

But, XP is still widely used and for now is the operating system I need to install on 90% of the cases. Of course first I install Windows XP, then the pc&amp;rsquo;s drivers and utilities, then I add whatever commercial software the client uses.
