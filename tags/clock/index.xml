Even my wife loved it. Bonus points if it&amp;rsquo;s very accurate.
I had in my parts box, for a very long time now, the display PCB from an old PH-meter. Old enough that it was done using Rusian 74141 clones - K155ID1 nixie drivers - a lot of logic chips (decade counters, serial latches, etc) and nixie tubes. It was also wired in a way that defied logic.</description></item><item><title>I’ve got Nixie’s</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/07/30/ive-got-nixies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2009 16:15:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/07/30/ive-got-nixies/</guid><description>Thanks to a local electronics forum I managed to get my hands on some Nixie tubes. Two sets to be exact. One set came complete with the original driver circuit board which has some very interesting Russian made Nixie drivers similar to the venerable 74141 and 7441. I think they are pretty rare too.
I hope that those drivers will simplify my circuit as they are high voltage drivers. I even managed to locate the datasheet !</description></item></channel></rss>
