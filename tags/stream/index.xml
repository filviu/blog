Since it&amp;rsquo;s always on (as oposed to my nas) I decided to add some storage so I can host my music and some tv shows. I checked some projects and stopped to test Sockso.The site is simple and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scream &amp;ldquo;open source project&amp;rdquo; but sockso seems really good at what it does. It works both as a gui and as a server tool and is available for windows, linux and mac.</description></item><item><title>Streaming video with a Raspberry PI and a Logitech C270</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/06/18/streaming-video-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-a-logitech-c270/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 18:31:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/06/18/streaming-video-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-a-logitech-c270/</guid><description>Hi,
I wanted to setup a live webcam using a Raspberry Pi (model B, first rev. with 256M RAM) so after checking and happily finding out that my camera is suported I went along. First I installed the support packages:
sudo apt-get install gstreamer-tools gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-good v4l-utils After that I wrote a small script that would start the stream:
#!/bin/bash # set below your Raspberry PI IP address myip=&amp;#34;192.168.xxx.xxx&amp;#34; port=&amp;#34;5000&amp;#34; gst-launch -v v4l2src !</description></item></channel></rss>
