I chose Tomato by Shibby specifically because it supports the 5GHz radio in this particular router model. But woe and behold after I installed the settings were not there, I could only see them for the 2.4GHz WiFi.
Well it turns out instructions are made to be followed, I got curious after install and logged right in, but it turns out you really have to do the last 30-30-30 reset.</description></item></channel></rss>
