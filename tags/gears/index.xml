I don&amp;rsquo;t need it for Gmail but I use the turbo feature of WordPress.
Well, a good soul over at the Google Gears User Group made a custom build. You should treat it as beta quality. It works for me on Windows but YMMV.
Probably official support is right around the corner if the fix is already in the latest source.</description></item><item><title>Firefox 3.5 fails to impress me.

In my opinion firefox fails to improve performance as promised. It has some new features, it has some bad new features and it misses the speed we want and need. Ajax sites seem just as slow as they were in Firefox 3.0. It still isn&amp;rsquo;t 100 on the ACID 3 test and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
