I take that back ðŸ™‚ Considering that still X3 was decent compared to 11 and 12 and also that X5 is pretty good considering Corel&amp;rsquo;s history and also most important because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen much more expensive piles of junk since I wrote this.
Nevertheless I, and probably you too have to use and maintain it. I had the following problem on a fresh installation of Windows XP SP3: every time I wanted to export, save as or open a drawing Corel Draw X3 would crash regularly with it&amp;rsquo;s darned Crash Wizard.</description></item></channel></rss>
