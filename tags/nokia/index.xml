Recently I wanted to see if I can connect it to an Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1). I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Too bad as I could really use the extra 32Gb the n900 has to offer. It would connect but the tablet disconnects it as soon as the phone tries to start charging.</description></item><item><title>I found the best themes for my E71</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/20/i-found-the-best-themes-for-my-e71/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2009 13:26:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/20/i-found-the-best-themes-for-my-e71/</guid><description>I gave up finding a nice theme for my E71 long ago. Even accepted the ugly icons. A few weeks ago I found a decent theme with ovi icons and got a bit happier. Today I had time to search a bit some more and I have some of the best Nokia E71 themes I found:
Ovi Blue from Nokia Conversations
Aviator, Enterprise and Zen Touch from Tehkseven - those are both with sevan and ovi icons.</description></item></channel></rss>
