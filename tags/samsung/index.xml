Recently I wanted to see if I can connect it to an Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1). I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Too bad as I could really use the extra 32Gb the n900 has to offer. It would connect but the tablet disconnects it as soon as the phone tries to start charging.</description></item><item><title>Working mediatomb config.xml for Samsung UE37C5000</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/09/13/working-mediatomb-config-xml-for-samsung-ue37c5000/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2011 14:11:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/09/13/working-mediatomb-config-xml-for-samsung-ue37c5000/</guid><description>I have a NAS and an Samsung UE37C5000 UPNP/DLNA enabled led TV. Streaming from the first to the second should be easy, right? Well after a few tweaks MediaTomb makes it possible.
I don&amp;rsquo;t say this is the best configuration possible but it&amp;rsquo;s the one that works INCLUDING pause and fast forwarding.
Relevant from the default are the custom header, extended protocol info and the mkv and avi lines.

Since we have a media-center PC the first thing I did was of course hook it up and test a few full hd clips to enjoy the new TV. Everything was nice and well until I switched the tv from the VGA cable I had lying around to a HDMI cable I just bought.</description></item></channel></rss>
