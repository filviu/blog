I am using the easypic 5 board from mikroelectronica to display a linegraph of the temperature read every second by the DS1820 sensor and displays it on the KS0108 based GLCD. I am using the OneWire and GLCD libraries that come with the mikroC compiler.
I am using a PIC16F887 mounted on the board. You might need to adjust the code if you use a different microcontroler / development board.</description></item></channel></rss>
