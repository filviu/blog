(You can use find for example to run it in multiple folders)
perl -pi -e &amp;#39;s/old_text/new_text/g&amp;#39; *.conf This line replaces old_text with new_text in all the .conf files in the current folder. Of course you can use regular expressions.</description></item><item><title>Installed Google Custom Search, no results are showing.</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/30/google-custom-search-no-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2009 18:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/30/google-custom-search-no-results/</guid><description>I did a website for a friend, a kind of a knowledge base and installed google custom search on it. To my surprise google stubornly kept showing no search results. I redid the custom search settings, paying close attention to the domains on which I wanted the search limited on, but still no results.
I took a quick walk on the Google Help boulevard but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything. A google search later and I found numerous causes: wrong definitions for the domains on which the search is limited, wrong integration of the code, wrong definition of the result page the form should point to.</description></item></channel></rss>
