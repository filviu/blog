For that I use both a password and IP based restrictions. The issue is that for example at home I have a dynamic allocated IP. One option would be to add a hostname in the apache rule, like this:
Allow from example.dyndns.org But this has some disadvantages:
it requires a dns lookup on each access it uglifies your access logs To get around this I moved away from Access control to a rewrite map.</description></item></channel></rss>
