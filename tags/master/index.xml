Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it:
Why would one want to set-up this? Easy.
Spread the read load across multiple servers:Â you can use the MySQL master for writing (inserts, updates) and the slave(s) for reading (SELECT) This should speed up things nicely for your application.
Do the backups from the slave. You might have noticed that backing-up, especially big databases, slows things down. That happens because mysqldump locks tables as it reads them.</description></item><item><title>Secondary DNS cannot transfer zone</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/11/03/secondary-dns-cannot-transfer-zone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2011 16:14:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/11/03/secondary-dns-cannot-transfer-zone/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m no Bind expert but I&amp;rsquo;m not a beginner either. I was configuring a secondary backup DNS for a master server and I noticed that after configuring everything the zones didn&amp;rsquo;t get replicated on the slave DNS. I checked the logs and saw the following:
First I thought there was a mistake related to a missing permission on the master configuration
allow-transfer { aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd; }; I double checked but the permissions were set correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
