Having just aquired a shabby XPC SK43G that simply refused to work as a htpc (it&amp;rsquo;s original purpose) I decided to set it up as a NAS (Network Attached Storage). I went out and bought a Western Digital Green 1 Tb Sata2 drive. The xpc refused to detect the drive until I set it via jumper as Sata1. I had to search on the Western Digital support pages, as the jumper settings are not documented on the drive itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
