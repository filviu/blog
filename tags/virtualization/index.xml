Recently I wanted to access a ntfs partition directly under Windows running inside a virtual machine. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to (easily) do it:
VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ./ntfs_test.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb -register&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; VirtualBox Command Line Management Interface Version 1.5.4 (C) 2005-2007 innotek GmbH All rights reserved. RAW host disk access VMDK file ./ntfs_test.vmdk created successfully. What this means? Well:
We create a virtual machine disk (vmdk) pointing to you physical drive.</description></item><item><title>Bye, bye, dual boot</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/bye-bye-dual-boot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 19:10:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/bye-bye-dual-boot/</guid><description>Ever since I discovered linux I ran a dual boot system. Linux (usually slackware) + windows (first &amp;lsquo;98 than, as soon as it was available XP). Windows 98 was problematic because it needed frequent reinstalling, pleasently overwriting the boot sector everytime requiring in turn to reinstall lilo.
Than XP solved this problem (not that it didn&amp;rsquo;t quietly overwrite the boot sector) by needing far less frequent reinstalls. When I found out about vmware I was very happy, dual boot seemed a thing of the past.</description></item></channel></rss>
