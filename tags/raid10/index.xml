Wikipedia has a nice write-up if you want it.
I had two options - using the motherboard&amp;rsquo;s Intel controller or software RAID. Coming from the Linux world I was expecting software raid to be easy enough to configure - I was wrong apparently in the Windows world options are more limited (mirrors and stripes) with only recently in Windows 8 Storage Spaces offering more options.</description></item></channel></rss>
