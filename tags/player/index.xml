Up until now I used vPlayer and the default video player on my Android Phone (galaxy S2) but on the tablet the default video player is very poor (or let's say simple) and vPlayer showed some weird artifacts, so to the search it is. I choose from other roundups and recommandations the following: BsPlayer FREE DICE Player MoboPlayer MX Player VLC Beta vPlayer All those players offer a nice, clean interface with similar basic functionality: resume position, some offer network playback, but not all video formats play the same in all players.</description></item><item><title>No album cover art in Symbian ^3 Belle on an E7</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/07/13/no-album-cover-art-in-symbian-3-belle-on-an-e7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:31:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/07/13/no-album-cover-art-in-symbian-3-belle-on-an-e7/</guid><description>Sooo, my beloved n900 kicked the bucket and the fine folks at Nokia Romania decided it&amp;rsquo;s not fixable and they replaced it. With an E7. After 6 weeks. Hey Nokia still wondering why you&amp;rsquo;re going down the drain?
I have my music neatly organized and with cover art embeded inside the id3tag. But it won&amp;rsquo;t show up. Actually it showed up for one album out of 15. So I started the hunt to see why.</description></item><item><title>VLC media player 1.0.0 â€“ Goldeneye is out !</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/07/08/vlc-media-player-1-0-0-goldeneye-is-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2009 08:27:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/07/08/vlc-media-player-1-0-0-goldeneye-is-out/</guid><description>In the good tradition of Open Source projects VideoLAN has been at a version &amp;lt; 1.0 for ages. Traditionally 1.0 would be a complete, stable release. Well VideoLAN is there. Actually has been there for some time, I use it constantly and besides an uglier than usual interface has been stable and useful for me.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know VideoLAN is a full featured Media Player for Windows, Linux, OSX and many more operating systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
