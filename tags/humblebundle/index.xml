I like to play the occasional game on the go and so I bought many of the bundles that humblebundle offered. Happily they also offer an android application that functions like a store - you can see all the games you bought and download/install/update them. Follow &lt;a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/app">these directions to install the Humble Bundle&lt;/a> app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read bellow is a list of the games I own and as I get time to test them I will update the status.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
