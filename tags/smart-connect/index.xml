Well I have a small update. It&amp;rsquo;s crap. From time to time my phone was unnable to connect to the internet, be it 3g or wi-fi untill I restarted it. I kept thinking it&amp;rsquo;s the phones problem, and waited for a firmware update. Well I managed to track the problem: it&amp;rsquo;s Smart Connect.</description></item><item><title>Access point groups on the Nokia 71</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/04/23/access-point-groups-on-the-nokia-71/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2009 14:42:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/04/23/access-point-groups-on-the-nokia-71/</guid><description>When I upgraded my phone from a venerable and branded Nokia E61 to a more modern Nokia E71 I quickly found out what most of the reviewers missed. The E71 has no Access Point Groups - one feature that I used a lot.
