I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Nagios to monitor servers and devices for years now. Lately as an exercise to learn more about nagios I installed a private instance that I use to monitor everything I can think of - from my personal servers to the number of hours we watch TV.
A nice use I found is to monitor the number of followers my twitter bots and personal account have.</description></item><item><title>A simple retweet bot using a collocated Raspberry PI</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/09/13/a-simple-retweet-bot-using-a-collocated-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2013 08:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2013/09/13/a-simple-retweet-bot-using-a-collocated-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>2023 Update With the number of changes since Twitter is under new ownership I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this can still work.
I have a Raspberry PI freely collocated by the nice people at pcextreme. Being a Jolla fan I found a new use for it. I made a Retweet bot that retweets everything #Jolla.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. First you need to define your new twitter app here. Install on your raspberry the tweepy twitter python library.</description></item><item><title>I’m not using Gravity for Twitter access on my phone</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/14/im-not-using-gravity-for-twitter-access-on-my-phone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2009 13:06:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/08/14/im-not-using-gravity-for-twitter-access-on-my-phone/</guid><description>Even though I like Gravity a lot, I chose a simpler FREEWARE symbian native application as a client for Twitter - Tweets60:
It&amp;rsquo;s simple, fast, and has access point prioritization built in.
It may not be as feature full as Gravity, but it&amp;rsquo;s free - so you can&amp;rsquo;t argue there. You can write your tweets, follow others and click links and more. Even more I find it faster than Gravity. Of course if you need or want to be able to upload pictures and other advanced features that Tweet60 misses for now you&amp;rsquo;ll need to shell out the (modest) price of Gravity.</description></item><item><title>What’s installed on my Nokia E71 and why.</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/05/26/whats-installed-on-my-nokia-e71-and-why/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2009 09:37:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/05/26/whats-installed-on-my-nokia-e71-and-why/</guid><description>As you might have noticed I am very fond of open source or freeware software. I like the community and the development pace of such projects, and of course I am fond of the price. So, before watching another top 10 freeware list, here&amp;rsquo;s a list from someone who actually used the programs for months or years and uses them on a daily basis:
