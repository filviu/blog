I was configuring a secondary backup DNS for a master server and I noticed that after configuring everything the zones didn&amp;rsquo;t get replicated on the slave DNS. I checked the logs and saw the following:
First I thought there was a mistake related to a missing permission on the master configuration
allow-transfer { aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd; }; I double checked but the permissions were set correctly.</description></item><item><title>DNS::ZoneParse has an undocumented $ORIGIN</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/11/02/dnszoneparse-has-an-undocumented-origin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 13:29:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2011/11/02/dnszoneparse-has-an-undocumented-origin/</guid><description>I was working writing a few scripts that should update a DNS zone file on the fly. I decided to use the DNS::ZoneParse perl module for convenience.
The example there is straightforward for changing MX records so I thought modifying it to change an A record should be a piece of cake. Right? Wrong!
For the love of it I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get my code to modify the record in question, it would always delete it.</description></item></channel></rss>
