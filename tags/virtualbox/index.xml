It&amp;rsquo;s easy, fast and free. Recently I had to revive an older Solaris guest that used to run under vmware, and to set it up to run under Virtualbox. I quickly found out that after the grub screen it enters a reboot loop and nothing seemed to help. I could boot into failsafe and mount the root partition as /a/
Someone suggested that the problem was that vmware had the disk as SCSI (c0t0d0s0) and virtualbox enumerated them as IDE (c0d0s0).</description></item><item><title>Mount a physical drive inside a Oracle VirtualBox Machine</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/07/27/mount-a-physical-drive-inside-a-oracle-virtualbox-machine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2010 09:17:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/07/27/mount-a-physical-drive-inside-a-oracle-virtualbox-machine/</guid><description>Sometimes I have to check drives under their native operating system. Recently I wanted to access a ntfs partition directly under Windows running inside a virtual machine. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to (easily) do it:
VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ./ntfs_test.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb -register&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; VirtualBox Command Line Management Interface Version 1.5.4 (C) 2005-2007 innotek GmbH All rights reserved. RAW host disk access VMDK file ./ntfs_test.vmdk created successfully. What this means? Well:
We create a virtual machine disk (vmdk) pointing to you physical drive.</description></item><item><title>Chrome OS</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/chrome-os/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 22:40:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/chrome-os/</guid><description>Since everybody is talking about it I really wanted to experience the all new big thing Google is preparing for us. The fine people over at Techcrunch already prepared a nice tutorial on how to install and run a Chrome virtual machine image so I wont go on to reinvent the wheel.
Let me just say that I am completely unimpressed. It&amp;rsquo;s a linux kernel with a browser on top of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
