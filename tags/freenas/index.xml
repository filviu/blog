I need a NAS so I can test live migration and I was set to buy 2 bay synology. But when a 140$ HP Gen8 Microserver was on offer I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no. FreeNAS might not be as polished as Synology but I would be getting 4 bays, two gigabit ports and iLO at a third of the price. Also it would offer the possibility of learning FreeNAS (my other, longtime NAS is slackware + zfs on linux).</description></item><item><title>Freenas and Bittorent/transmission problems</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/01/freenas-and-bittorenttransmission-problems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 17:40:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/01/freenas-and-bittorenttransmission-problems/</guid><description>As I mentioned in another post I run a FreeNAS 0.69.1(at the time of posting) based machine on my network, for backup, downloads and storage. I also use it to leave downloads running when I&amp;rsquo;m not at home. FreeNAS is great but I had this problems when downloading torrents:
Yesterday I left it downloading the latest ubuntu version. (Yes I know I&amp;rsquo;m behind), it&amp;rsquo;s been out for some time now. When I got back from town I just shut down the nas without checking on progress.</description></item></channel></rss>
