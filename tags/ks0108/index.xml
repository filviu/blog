Others work but this one works for sure.
If you want to see the source code (I&amp;rsquo;m not particulary proud of it ðŸ™‚ )Â drop a comment and I&amp;rsquo;ll send it to you.
If the bitmap is smaller than 128Ã—64 it will be left as is, if not it will be resized proportionally to 128Ã—64.
You can set the name you want your variable to have and you can also set if you want the picture inverted or not.</description></item><item><title>KS0108 Graphics Library for PIC16F microcontrollers</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/12/01/ks0108-graphics-library-for-pic16f-microcontrollers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 15:23:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/12/01/ks0108-graphics-library-for-pic16f-microcontrollers/</guid><description>Not that I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with the default mikroC library for the KS0108 graphic displays, as I always I wanted something with the source available. Considering that I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner with microcontrolers having the source available to hack around is a very valuable learning tool.
The project is based on the source found here:
http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/ks0108/
The source is made pretty universal, still it took some work and modifications to have it working in mikroC.</description></item><item><title>Temperature graph on GLCD with EasyPic5</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/18/temperature-graph-on-glcd-with-easypic5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2009 17:17:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/18/temperature-graph-on-glcd-with-easypic5/</guid><description>This is a small project I did for school. I am using the easypic 5 board from mikroelectronica to display a linegraph of the temperature read every second by the DS1820 sensor and displays it on the KS0108 based GLCD. I am using the OneWire and GLCD libraries that come with the mikroC compiler.
I am using a PIC16F887 mounted on the board. You might need to adjust the code if you use a different microcontroler / development board.</description></item></channel></rss>
