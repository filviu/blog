Since ignoring _the &amp;ldquo;__If it works don&amp;rsquo;t fix it&amp;rdquo; _mantra is always a good idea. Beautiful, after update two of my disks from a four disk RAID10 array were showing as Non-RAID Disk. I had backups but shuffling 2TB+ of data is never fun.
Initial reports were all grim, the Intel RST BIOS does not allow repairing.</description></item></channel></rss>
