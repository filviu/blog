Be it because of the BIOS update to a beta or because of my drives but my RAID10 keeps failing. I documented before how to repair such a broken array but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go ahead with it too many times as data corruption is only one step away. Knowing that at least one of the disks has some minor issues (mdadm kicked it out some time ago when the disks were running under linux) I decided to check smart details and only keep only two of the disks in RAID1.</description></item><item><title>Intel RST RAID Non-RAID Disk after BIOS update</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2015/10/14/intel-rst-raid-non-raid-disk-after-bios-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 06:06:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2015/10/14/intel-rst-raid-non-raid-disk-after-bios-update/</guid><description>So, having nothing better to do and for no good reason I decided to update my workstation&amp;rsquo;s BIOS to the latest version released by Gigabyte. Since ignoring _the &amp;ldquo;__If it works don&amp;rsquo;t fix it&amp;rdquo; _mantra is always a good idea. Beautiful, after update two of my disks from a four disk RAID10 array were showing as Non-RAID Disk. I had backups but shuffling 2TB+ of data is never fun.
Initial reports were all grim, the Intel RST BIOS does not allow repairing.</description></item></channel></rss>
