One issue I found was that I have a custom script that takes magnet links and adds them to my NAS server instead of opening them locally. Chrome insisted on opening them with ktorrent instead of my custom script. The fix isÂ to create a file torrent.sh.desktop inside ~/.local/share/applications/ with the following content:
[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Exec=/usr/local/bin/torrent.sh %u MimeType=x-scheme-handler/magnet; Name=torrent.</description></item><item><title>Chrome OS</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/chrome-os/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 22:40:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/11/22/chrome-os/</guid><description>Since everybody is talking about it I really wanted to experience the all new big thing Google is preparing for us. The fine people over at Techcrunch already prepared a nice tutorial on how to install and run a Chrome virtual machine image so I wont go on to reinvent the wheel.
Let me just say that I am completely unimpressed. It&amp;rsquo;s a linux kernel with a browser on top of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
