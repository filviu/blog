The included start-up script was dependent on start-stop-daemon that is mission on Slackware. The examples on the transmission forums were ok but would resulted in transmission running as root and I want it to run as a non-privileged user. So I modified an example script to read like this:
#!/bin/bash #Slackware startup deamon script # Name of Service NAME=&amp;#34;Transmission Daemon&amp;#34; # Command to run CMD=&amp;#34;/usr/bin/transmission-daemon&amp;#34; # Option to run with deamon # -a means from where to accept incoming connections, comma separated # you may want to add your local network if you have multiple clients OPTIONS=&amp;#34;-a 127.</description></item></channel></rss>
