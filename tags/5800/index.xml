But my wife&amp;rsquo;s had it with her old 7610 so we upgraded her phone. After some deliberation, and her not liking the design of the e55 and e52 she finally settled for a Nokia 5800.
As you know that&amp;rsquo;s a 5th edition, touchscreen phone. I was a bit reticent because it&amp;rsquo;s never a good idea to get the first product from a series (that being the first Nokia touchscreen), still after reading a few reviews getting the 5800 seemed like a good idea.</description></item></channel></rss>
