It has one issue though, you can&amp;rsquo;t set a limit.
So a little code hacking is in order. Open modules/mod_related_items/helper.php and go to line 94 (right after the _Filter by language_ if_) and modify
$db&amp;gt;setQuery($query); to read:
$db-&amp;gt;setQuery($query,0,10); Of course you can change the limit from 10 with whatever you like.</description></item><item><title>Uploading big files via php</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/02/11/uploading-big-files-php/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2010 09:43:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2010/02/11/uploading-big-files-php/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m updating a site for a client that only has file access to his hosting account via a php file manager (extPlorer for Joomla to be precise). He needed uploaded a few flash videos (in excess of 15 Mb each) but extPlorer stated that the file limit for php was set to 8 Mb.
I already knew that .htaccess overrides were allowed since I used .htaccess to enable a seo component for the site.</description></item></channel></rss>
