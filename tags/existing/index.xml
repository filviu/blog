I need a NAS so I can testÂ live migration and I was set to buy 2 bay synology. But when a 140$ HP Gen8 Microserver was on offer I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no. FreeNAS might not be as polished as Synology but I would be getting 4 bays, two gigabit ports and iLO at a third of the price. Also it would offer the possibility of learning FreeNAS (my other, longtime NAS is slackware + zfs on linux).</description></item></channel></rss>
