Since ignoring _the &amp;ldquo;__If it works don&amp;rsquo;t fix it&amp;rdquo; _mantra is always a good idea. Beautiful, after update two of my disks from a four disk RAID10 array were showing as Non-RAID Disk. I had backups but shuffling 2TB+ of data is never fun.
Initial reports were all grim, the Intel RST BIOS does not allow repairing.</description></item><item><title>Slow ZFS write performance</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2014/01/30/slow-zfs-write-performance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 10:26:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2014/01/30/slow-zfs-write-performance/</guid><description>A note to self more than anything.
While I was rebuilding my HP N40L Microserver storage to use new drives and ZFS I experienced very slow (&amp;lt;20MB/s ) First I thought that it was because the source was a degraded RAID5 and performance was lost due to parity. But when the target was a network share instead of the local ZFS pool write speeds went to a more respectable 60-70MB/s.</description></item></channel></rss>
