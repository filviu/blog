Two sets to be exact. One set came complete with the original driver circuit board which has some very interesting Russian made Nixie drivers similar to the venerable 74141 and 7441. I think they are pretty rare too.
I hope that those drivers will simplify my circuit as they are high voltage drivers. I even managed to locate the datasheet !</description></item></channel></rss>
