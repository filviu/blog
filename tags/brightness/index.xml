Go toÂ codingtony/acer-brightness-linux-acpiÂ and follow the instructions. Change /etc/acpi/events/acer-tm-brightness-down andÂ /etc/acpi/events/acer-tm-brightness-up with the correct events:
event=video/brightnessdown BRTDN 00000087 00000000 and
event=video/brightnessup BRTUP 00000086 00000000 Restart acpid and the shortcuts should start working.</description></item><item><title>Fixing a self pressing button on an Asus VW202SR monitor</title><link>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/01/17/fixing-a-self-pressing-button-on-an-asus-vw202sr-monitor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2012 18:51:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2012/01/17/fixing-a-self-pressing-button-on-an-asus-vw202sr-monitor/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/blog/images/2012/" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, today instead of working I had the pleasure of fixing the monitor ðŸ™‚ The monitor is an older Asus VW202 SR that my wife uses connected to the laptop. I tried everything else (power cycling, another signal cable, another computer) but it turns out to be really the button. The issue manifested itself by the brightness setting window appearing and going eventually all the way to 100. First I thought that the button was stuck in the frame but it was safely depressed. That means a broken button on the pcb board. I thought it would be pretty easy to solder a new one in place.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
