So I decided to write my own adc read function, so I can better understand the PIC ADC converter operation. And, in the good spirit of open source I decided to share my code. The following code is the ADC on LCD example supplied by MikroElectronika with their EasyPic5 board, and it&amp;rsquo;s written in MikroC Pro.</description></item><item><title>Temperature graph on GLCD with EasyPic5</title><link>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/18/temperature-graph-on-glcd-with-easypic5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2009 17:17:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://silviuvulcan.ro/blog/2009/06/18/temperature-graph-on-glcd-with-easypic5/</guid><description>This is a small project I did for school. I am using the easypic 5 board from mikroelectronica to display a linegraph of the temperature read every second by the DS1820 sensor and displays it on the KS0108 based GLCD. I am using the OneWire and GLCD libraries that come with the mikroC compiler.
I am using a PIC16F887 mounted on the board. You might need to adjust the code if you use a different microcontroler / development board.</description></item></channel></rss>
