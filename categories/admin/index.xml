At some point I realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in years, backed it up and shut everything down. Since then a few things happened: I got into 3D printing, have a sometime interesting $dayjob, gave up on Facebook (never been much active on twitter). All those are going towards me wanting to share stuff (I&amp;rsquo;m sure all 3 of you reading this will be happy) and having no place to do it.</description></item></channel></rss>
